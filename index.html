<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a web developer, and a student of Music Computing. I enjoy long walks in the park and frivolous convoluted website build systems. This dude currently abides in New Cross, London. I aspire to abide all over the world in my life time. Other aspirations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Having my code executed in space</li>
        <li>Solving the housing/food/population crises</li>
        <li>Furthering the cause of rational, reasonable thought</li>
        <li>Actually following through on one of my many commitments to maintain blogs I've started</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Music Computing involves a huge variety of different ways of applying computing to music. In particular, I focus on widespread interactive systems, DSP, and generative music. If I had kept to my promise of maintaining a blog of the projects I completed at university, I would be able to back that up. That said, I mainly just focus on code, rather than the actual music.</p>
    <p>As for web development, I have been writing websites for quite some time. I have experience with websites written in PHP, Python, Java, C#, and Javascript, although I would rather forget more than one of those experiences. I am also an accomplished clientside scripter, who, while competent in several libraries that makes things easier, is most comfortable in vanilla Javascript.</p>
    <p>Outside of academia and my professional life, I have from time to time enjoyed live music (both attending and performing), theatre, and spending time with friends. I've not made enough time for this recently, and in my final year my undergraduate program fully intend to make the most of the amount of spare time I am priveleged to have as a student.</p>
    <p>I am trained in CPR, some first aid, and rescuing swimmers in distress, although I'm very rusty.</p>
